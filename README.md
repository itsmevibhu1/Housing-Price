# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction with Machine Learning
Welcome! This project is all about building a machine learning model to predict housing prices — something that's useful, interesting, and surprisingly fun to work on. The entire process is documented in the Jupyter notebook included here, from data exploration to making final predictions.

Whether you're learning ML, prepping for Kaggle, or just exploring real-world datasets, this repo should give you a solid hands-on walkthrough.

🔍 **What’s Inside**
In this notebook, we take a dataset of house features (like square footage, number of rooms, location details, etc.) and try to predict the Sale Price of each house. The approach follows the typical ML pipeline:

Understand the data

Clean it up

Engineer useful features

Train several models

Compare results and pick the best one

🧠 **Tools & Libraries Used**
This project is powered by Python and some of its most popular data science libraries:

Pandas & NumPy – for data wrangling

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for exploring and visualizing trends

Scikit-learn – for model building and evaluation

XGBoost – for advanced boosting-based predictions

🧭 **Step-by-Step Flow**
Here’s a quick look at what happens inside the notebook:

Load the data – Get a feel for what we’re working with

Explore patterns – What drives house prices?

Handle missing values – Because real-world data is never perfect

Feature engineering – Transform and combine features to improve the model

Model training – Try out multiple models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and XGBoost

Cross-validation – Make sure the model generalizes well

Final predictions – Generate outputs for test data and prepare a submission

📈 **Results**
After experimenting with different models and tuning a bit, XGBoost gave the best results in terms of predictive performance. We evaluated our model using Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE), a metric that works well when predicting prices.
